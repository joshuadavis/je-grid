      <title>Background</title>
      <p>This project was started to fulfill a need for a simple, lightweight framework for making a
      back-end 'compute farm' for a web service that offers it's shared computational power to customers.
      This particular application already had a J2EE-based front end which is great for all the OLTP, web UI and
      SOAP tasks, but it was very clear that J2EE was not intended to handle long running, compute-bound
      tasks that require lots of memory and CPU.   So, a grid framework was designed to allow the J2EE application
      to serve as a front end for the compute farm.

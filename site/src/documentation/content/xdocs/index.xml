      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
      JEGrid is a light weight <strong>enterprise grid framework for Java</strong> that provides
      <strong>federation</strong> (clustering), <strong>coarse-grained parallelism</strong>, and
      <strong>load balancing</strong>.
      Using the coarse-grained parallelism features, super-computer performance can be realized with
      COTS (Commodity, Off The Shelf) hardware which is more economical, more scaleable, and
      more familiar to IT personell.

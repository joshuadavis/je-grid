      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>EnterGrid is an <strong>enterprise grid framework for Java</strong>.   With EnterGrid, application developers
          can write computationally intensive code that can be scaled out using
          COTS (Commodity, Off-The-Shelf) machines without any change to the sofware.  Developers
          can also take advantage of coarse-grained parallel processing available in network of
          COTS machines.
